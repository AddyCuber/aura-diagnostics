AURA Diagnostics - Main FastAPI Application

This is the entry point for our multi-agent AI diagnostic system.
Starting simple with a hello world to make sure everything's wired up correctly.

Why FastAPI? It's async by default, has automatic API docs, and plays nice with Pydantic.
Perfect for our AI agents that'll be making lots of concurrent API calls.

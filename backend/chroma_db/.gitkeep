# This file ensures the chroma_db directory is tracked by git
# 
# ChromaDB will create its database files in this directory when the application runs.
# The .gitkeep file makes sure the directory structure is preserved in version control
# even when the database files themselves are not committed.
#
# Database files should be added to .gitignore to avoid committing large binary files
# and sensitive data to the repository.

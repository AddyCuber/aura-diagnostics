AURA Diagnostics - Database Setup Script

This script creates our SQLite database with the core tables we need:
- patients: Store patient information and medical history
- audit_log: Track every action our AI agents take for full transparency

Why SQLite? It's perfect for development and small deployments. No server needed,
just a file on disk. Easy to backup, version control, and debug.

Run this script once to set up your database: python setup_db.py
